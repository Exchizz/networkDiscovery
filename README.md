I wrote this tool at a LAN party (48 hours), bugs exist and it's not pretty... :b 

# networkDiscovery
This tool discovers and draws a network topology by collecting information about the network from managed switches.
Information about connected hosts is aquired using SNMP to get the MAC address table from the managed switches. Information about uplinks is managed on the network by LLDP and there by collected using SNMP from the switches.
